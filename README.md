# PW-2.0
The password of the future

In a world where almost everything goes over the internet security in more important than ever. Passwords play a vital role in this security, but is the regular old password still viable for the level of competition between hackers and those that try to protect your money and privacy? No. A regular password is outdated, and needs renewal. One way of cracking a password right now is to just try out every option, and after enough time you will find the password. But what if you just take a very long password? In that case you have to remember a very long password. This would not be bad if you could have this same password for every single website, but no. You need a password of around 20 up- and downcase letters and numbers, and none can be occur twice. Can you even think of what this means. This kind of password for every single site that requires a password. This is where Password-2.0 comes in. A 2.0 password is only 6 numbers long, and still impossible to brute-force. This is because the passwords consist of out blocks of three numbers, and your password consists out of two. But the strength of PW-2.0 is shown when a wrong password is filled in: a new block is added. When someone would try to bruteforce your password, every wrong try results in another block needed to fill in before he/she is done.
And THIS is how our security is guaranteed.
